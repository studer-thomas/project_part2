            <h1><em>Exploring France</em></h1> 
            <p>The majority or world traveler sign up for tours that take them to some of the 
			top tourist destinations in the world. They spend a very short time in each destination, 
			and get to see the important sites. But they never really get the opportunity to immerse 
			themselves in the culture, and explore the country in depth.</p> 
			<p>My goal is to visit and  experience every region in France. Understand the history and 
			culture of France in detail.</p>
			<p>France is renowned for its diverse regions, each boasting unique landscapes, 
			cultures, cuisines, and histories. And I plan on visiting and experiencing it all.
			Here's a brief overview of some of the distinct regions that I have explored and what 
			I believe sets them apart.</p>
