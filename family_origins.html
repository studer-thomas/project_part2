            <h1><em>The Discovery That I'm French!</em></h1> 
            <p>With a last name of Studer, and having grown up in a household where my 	<!--float. This article has been floated left-->
			parents regularly spoke German, it would be reasonable to think that your 
			family heritage is clearly German. And that is what my aunts and uncles believed, 
			until one of my uncles, Richard Studer, decided to discover the true roots of our family.</p>
			<p>A family bible, that had been passed down through many generations, was in the 
			possession of my uncle, Lawrence Studer. This bible had been given to one 
			Amandus Studer by his mother as he was preparing to leave Europe for the ‘New World’ 
			of North America in 1847. The bible, with numerous handwritten notes in German, had served for
			many years as a symbolic representation of the family history, and had never been 
			seriously analyzed to better understand our family’s heritage. The picture to the right
			is Amandus Studer and his wife Francisca in the later years of their life.</p>

               <h1>The Search Begins</h1>
               <p>My uncle Richard decided that this bible would provide him with a great starting 
			   point to begin his journey in establishing the family tree. Richard began a deep 
			   dive into the family bible and discovered a short translation of one of the 
			   handwritten notes in German. </p>
			   <p>In it, it said that the bible was the property of 
			   one Amandus Studer of the village of ‘Overbush’ located in Eastern France. 
			   Extremely excited by this discovery, Richard believed it would be a simple task 
			   to look up the name of this village in France and continue his search for the families’ roots. </p>

               <p>He could find no such village named ‘Overbush’ in France. 
			   Undaunted, he decided to find someone who could take another look at the 
			   handwritten notes in German and see if the translation was correct.</p> 
			   <p>He found a gentleman who was fluent in German, and after a retranslation of the text, 
			   discovered that the name of the village was actually Oberbrook, located in 
			   the Alsace region of France.</p>

               <p>The discovery that Amandus Studer had received this bible from his mother 
			   in Oberbrook, France set off a series of trips to the region by my uncle, as 
			   well as other members of the family.</p>
			   <p> All in search of a deeper understanding of our history. The net result of 
			   this research, based on many trips to the region, was the revelation that the 
			   Studer name first appeared in in the area around Oberbrook in 1591!</p>

               <h1>From Alsace to Canada</h1>
               <p>The uncle of Amandus Studer’s wife Francisca had emigrated to St. Agatha, 
			   Canada a number of years before.  Amandus and his wife Francisca made the decision 
			   to go to Canada sometime in 1847 in search of a better life.</p>
			   <p>They arrived in St. Agatha, Ontario, Canada, which is 40 miles west of Toronto, 
			   soon after crossing the Atlantic.  At that time, St. Agatha was a small colony of 
			   German speaking peoples, many of whom had emigrated there from Alsace. Amandus was 
			   a cobbler, as was his father, and his grandfather.  While in St. Agatha he and his 
			   wife raised a large family of 10 children, 7 boys and 3 girls.</p>	               
            </div>
			<div class="specials">
               <h1>Finally in Minnesota</h1>
               <p>Around 1869, Amandus moved his family from St. Agatha to a small farming 
			   community in Lena, Illinois, which is located in the northwest corner of Illinois. 
			   There, they made a change in their lifestyle and began farming.</p>
			   <p> After 5 years of farming in Lena, the Studers moved, once again to Iowa and 
			   resumed farming.</p>
			   <p> It is from there that the some of the married children of Amandus 
			   moved to northern Minnesota in search of a better life. There, in the area of St. Cloud 
			   Minnesota where my father Robert was born. And the rest is history. Or should I say, "French History"</p>
